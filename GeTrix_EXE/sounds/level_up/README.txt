LEVEL UP SOUND EFFECTS

This directory contains sound effects that play when the player levels up in the game.

To add your own level up sounds:
1. Simply place your sound files in this directory
2. Supported formats: .wav, .mp3, .ogg
3. The game will randomly select from all available sounds in this directory

The sound should be exciting and indicate progression, like a fanfare or achievement sound.

BLOCK LAND SOUND EFFECTS

This directory contains sound effects that play when a Tetris block lands on the ground.

To add your own block landing sounds:
1. Simply place your sound files in this directory
2. Supported formats: .wav, .mp3, .ogg
3. The game will randomly select from all available sounds in this directory

The sound should be short and impactful, like a thud or tap sound.

CUSTOM SOUND PACKS INSTRUCTIONS
        
This directory allows you to create and manage custom sound packs for the Tetris game.

How to Create a Custom Sound Pack:
1. Create a new folder in this directory with your sound pack name (e.g., 'my_sounds')
2. Add your custom sound files to this folder using these filenames:
   - block_land.wav: Plays when a block lands on the ground
   - line_clear.wav: Plays when a line is cleared
   - level_up.wav: Plays when the player levels up
   - game_over.wav: Plays when the game ends
3. The game will automatically detect your sound pack

Supported File Formats:
- MP3 (.mp3)
- OGG Vorbis (.ogg)
- WAV (.wav)

GAME OVER SOUND EFFECTS

This directory contains sound effects that play when the game ends.

To add your own game over sounds:
1. Simply place your sound files in this directory
2. Supported formats: .wav, .mp3, .ogg
3. The game will randomly select from all available sounds in this directory

The sound should indicate the end of the game, like a dramatic or sad sound effect.

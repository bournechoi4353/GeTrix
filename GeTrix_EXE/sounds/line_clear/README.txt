LINE CLEAR SOUND EFFECTS

This directory contains sound effects that play when a line is cleared in the game.

To add your own line clear sounds:
1. Simply place your sound files in this directory
2. Supported formats: .wav, .mp3, .ogg
3. The game will randomly select from all available sounds in this directory

The sound should be satisfying and indicate success, like a chime or swoosh sound.

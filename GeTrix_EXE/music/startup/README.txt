# Startup Music

This directory contains music that plays during the startup animation.

## How to add your own startup music:

1. Place your music file in this directory (MP3 format recommended)
2. Name your file "startup_theme.mp3" (or update the code to use your filename)
3. The music will automatically play during the startup animation

## Requirements:
- File format: MP3 or OGG (recommended for better compatibility with Pygame)
- Duration: 8-10 seconds is ideal for the default animation length
- Volume: Ensure the volume is normalized to avoid being too loud

## Notes:
- If multiple music files are present, the game will use "startup_theme.mp3" by default
- You can customize the filename in the code if needed
